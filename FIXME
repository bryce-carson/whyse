This file contains code excerpts and thoughts related to issues in both the
documentation and implementation of whyse.

FIXME: finduses.nw and the recognizer.nw need some tweaking to better support
LISP identifiers. It may be as simple as moving `-' from SYMBOLS to
ALPHANUMERIC.

FIXME: Noweb's troff macros cause code chunks to have an inconsistent size, and
also prohibit chunks breaking over multiple pages (which must be possible in the
case of very large chunks).
