abstract="In this paper we describe a hypertext presentation for the WEB system for literate programming. The requirements for an environment for modern literate programming are analyzed and the WEB hypertext system is proposed. Different types of windows for displaying text, indices and graphical representations are discussed. All semantic links and operators using them are analyzed. The proposed architecture of the WEB hypertext system includes a general purpose relational database management system. Mapping between hypertext queries and relational database queries is provided. The system allows the user to define new hypertext operations by providing the corresponding SQL queries for the underlying relational database. The described system can be easily extended by many other types of queries and applications.",
